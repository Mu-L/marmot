## What & Why?

Marmot v2 is a leaderless, distributed SQLite replication system built on a gossip-based protocol with distributed transactions and eventual consistency.

**Key Features:**
- **Leaderless Architecture**: No single point of failure - any node can accept writes
- **MySQL Protocol Compatible**: Connect with any MySQL client (DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, mysql CLI)
- **Distributed Transactions**: Percolator-style write intents with conflict detection
- **Multi-Database Support**: Create and manage multiple databases per cluster
- **DDL Replication**: Distributed schema changes with automatic idempotency and cluster-wide locking
- **Production-Ready SQL Parser**: Powered by rqlite/sql AST parser for MySQL→SQLite transpilation
- **CDC-Based Replication**: Row-level change data capture for consistent replication
